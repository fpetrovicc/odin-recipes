# Recipes

This project is very valuable to learn the workflow in, because essentially you will learn how to set up the git repo, use SSH to clone it & communicate with GitHub.

It is not that hard, but it is absolutely critical to do it right, as it sets the base for the whole project.

This project for now will only contain links to other pages, but later it will be expanded and prettified with CSS.
