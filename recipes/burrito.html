        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> 
            Burrito is a dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine that took form 
            in Mexican cuisine, consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped 
            into a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, 
            make it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself. 
            Burritos are often eaten by hand, as their tight wrapping 
            keeps the ingredients together. Burritos can also be served "wet", 
            i.e., covered in a savory and spicy sauce, 
            when they would be eaten with a fork and knife.
