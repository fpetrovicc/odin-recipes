        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> 
            A churro is a type of fried dough from Spanish and 
            Portuguese cuisine. They are also found in Latin American 
            cuisine and in other areas that have received immigration 
            from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries, especially 
            in the Southwestern United States and France.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Spain, churros can either be thin (and sometimes knotted) 
            or long and thick, where they are known as porras or 
            jeringos in some regions. They are normally eaten for 
            breakfast dipped in champurrado, hot chocolate, dulce de 
            leche or caf√© con leche. Cinnamon sugar is often sprinkled on 
            top.
